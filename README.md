# Unity Renamer

This is a simple tool that allows you to select mulitple objects and rename them with the option to add a prefix, suffix and numbering.  
This project was a way to introduce me to Unity tool creation, though this I got to learn more about good C# coding practices and Editor GUIs in Unity.
